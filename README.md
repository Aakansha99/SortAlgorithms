# sorting-algorithms
Different sorting algorithms and their visualizations using D3.
This is a homework for TCSS 531 at UW Tacoma.

Grader, if you found this online and searched my code and think that it is plagiarism, I (Inno Irving V. Estrera) am the one who wrote this repository LOL.

# Dependencies
Obviously `git` because you wouldn't be here, `NodeJS` and the `lite-server` npm module

## Run from localhost
```
git clone https://github.com/Irving09/sorting-algorithms.git
cd sorting-algorithms
npm install
npm start

```
